What is an `Object`?<br/>
An object is an unordered list of primitive data types (and sometimes reference data types) that is stored as a series of name-value pairs. Each item in the list is called a property (functions are called methods).

Consider this object example:<br/>
`const myObj = {"firstName":"john", "lastName":"Doe"};`

An `Object` is a list of items. Each item contains a property or a method in the list.
The list is stored in key-value pair.

In the above `Object` the keys (or) properties are "firstName" and "lastName".
The values for the keys are "john" and "Doe" respectively.
